## Features

### Authentication

The project utilizes multiple authentication methods, including:

### Cookies HttpOnly:

Secure authentication using HttpOnly cookies for session management.

### JWT Tokens:

JSON Web Tokens are used for secure user authentication and authorization.

### User Roles

The system supports two user roles:

Admin Users: Have access to protected areas, including management of products, categories, orders, and toppings.
Normal Users: Can interact with the menu, add products to the cart, and place orders.
Admin Dashboard
Admin users have access to a dashboard with the following information:

### Monthly sales statistics.

Sales reports and graphical representations.
Guest Users
When normal users access the menu page without logging in, a guest user profile is created in the database.
Guest users can interact with the menu and save their cart information in the database.

### Social Login

Users can sign up or log in using social login (e.g., OAuth) methods.
Upon social login, the guest user profile is updated to a normal user with email and password, and their cart information is retained.

### Cart Functionality

Normal users can interact with their cart, adding products, specifying quantities, and adding toppings if available.
Cart information is stored securely in the database for each user.

Test scripts and procedures are provided for quality assurance.
